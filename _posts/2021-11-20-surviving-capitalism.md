Title: Surviving Capitalism
---


It's only when you start to analyse all our engraved culture through the lenses of critical theory, that you start to see how everything leans towards only one thing: profit.
Every minute routine habit of ours is only there for that goal. Why do you eat breakfast in the morning? Because the fifties cereal companies thought it would increase sales (spoiler: it did). Why do you use chemical filled shampoo? Because chemical companies thought it would profit them (spoiler: it did). Why do you eat three meals a day, live with your nuclear family, go to church...? Because organisations thought it would make them money (spoiler: it did). 
The system is not for or against individuals, only for organisations.

It's impressive how many of these habits have proven to be actually bad for you. Capitalism will always sell you something that causes you a problem, so that it can also sell you a solution.

It's actually kind of adorable when people believe that 'the free market works', that 'working contributes to society', and that 'laissez faire politics is the solution'. It's the same feeling you get when you see a teenager believing in Santa Claus. It's kind of cute that they are hopeful that such unplausible things exist, but on the other hand 'isn't he a bit too old to still believe in this fantasy?'. So if you still believe in it, I'm sorry to be the one ruining the magic, but it's time you grow up. Everyone should outgrow blatant ignorance eventually.

Well, you might think (like I did), that maybe if well regulated the free market could actually benefit most people. But then I started again questioning for exactly who is legislation being made, and you must imagine my surprise when I found out it's for organisations. For example, as exposed in this book [^1], in the US only industrialised agriculture is legal, the traditional way is actually prohibited with excuse of public safety but clearly for profit sake, since the industry made food has been proven way worse for your health than traditionally made.

What's most interesting is the same regulatory institutions let the big chemical corps self regulate and knowingly mine all that is produced with them. Nowadays, that means almost everything - from the air we breathe, to the food we eat. Our pans have CFOAs (a fatal compost) that has been infecting our foods for almost a century. Almost any sweet thing you taste as either saccharin, aspartame, sucralose... or some other of the giant list of artificial sweeteners that have been proved to cause cancer. The micro plastic that fills the guts of the animals we fish. 
Creating therefore a system where it is illegal to produce un-poisoned goods, because it's not as profitable as producing poisoned ones.
There's no way out. The only way to stop consuming poison is illegally. I cannot understand how anyone can defend such system. 
It's only legal to sell actual poison for global food chains, but illegal to sell natural home growne food to your neighbouring community, because it's more profitable. The incentives are all wrong.

I use to wonder why so many people were dying so much younger. Now I'm starting to wonder how so many people are still alive.


I have a profound hate for capitalism for it literally kills countless lives (from diseases created by the toxic environment, wars, suicides...); Leaves in suffering most of the remain (from the effects of labour culture, health problems from poison consumption, poverty...); And the rest is only 'happy' for how alienated they are by the ideology, for ignorance is bliss, incapable to even grasp its obvious and terrifying wickedness.


So what now?
It's not like it's gonna make a difference on the whole, but it can to me and you.

(1) Don't work or buy from the big companies. Always choose local community based businesses, that actually create value in your and your neighbours life.

(2) Don't let the system control you. Avoid all news. Avoid algorithmic recommendations. Avoid automated feeds. Install ad-blocker and anti-trackers. Choose privacy.

(3) Don't rely on the system. Always choose autonomy. The less dependent you're on society, the less control it will have ove you. Self-produce the most you can, buy the lees you can.  

And above all, have a critical approach to everything. Anytime you do anything just think 'Am I doing this in my favour, or is it just profitable for big corps?'. Never trust anyone. You're all by yourself. The only person who cares about you is yourself and your loved ones. Never 'the state', never 'society', never 'science', only you.
