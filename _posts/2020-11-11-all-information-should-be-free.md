title: All Information Should Be Free
---

Don't get me wrong, I'm all for individual privacy and I believe it is an integral part of freedom, but that is not the case for organisations.
For organisations there's only one reason for hiding information: exploitings other's ignorance.
I cannot find a single case of a company hiding secrets from the public that is not just to disguise mallice.

Whisthleblowing shouldn't only not be illegal but encouraged. Whistleblowing is always putting foward what's truth.
A company being worried about whistleblowers should immediatly be a red flag.
I don't get why people get so shocked when a communist state (like China's) does it, but so defensive when it's done by a private corporation.

The old 'If you have nothing to hide, you shouldn't worry about privacy' may be ridiculous for personal privacy, but quite legitamate when talking about corporations. 
The only reason big businesses have power is because of how easily they can manage public perception by hiding information from them. Take away that power and you'll have less corrupt companies. 

Take big cases of Exxon, Dupont and Pfizer. All the malice they have repeatedly done to global public health - destroying our climate, poisining almost everything we consume, produce and distribute harmful drugs, respectively - would all be avoided if their nefarious actions, studies, and knowledge were public in the first place. What these companies did was knowingly harm the global masses for profit while hiding it from everyone. That would never be possible if information was free.  

Imagine a world where you didn't eat cacerinogenic food because it's health effects were public.
Where you could buy water from a safe provider because it was public that the competitor's is lead poisoned. 
Imagine a world where corporate interests were public and so you no longer needed to act blindly. 
Imagine an actual free market.

In a world where everything is about information, where power is information. The best way do descentrelize power is by making information public.
So just install your Traits OS on a falsh drive and start whistleblowing. 
It's the first step for a freer world.
