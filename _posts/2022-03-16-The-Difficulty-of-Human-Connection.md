title: The Difficulty of Human Connection

Loneliness must be one of the the most common unpleasant feelings in current society, and I've been feeling it myself quite strongly for as long as I can remember.

This huge crave for other people is something that goes way before the anthropocene. From the evolutive perspective it's only logical that the isolation from others can cause such unbearable suffering, for in a wilderness context it would mean everything for one's survival. If my tribe rejected me, I doubt I would be able to thrive on my own. So over generations a reward mechanism found a way to make that less likely - loneliness. If you ever felt the pain of loneliness, you surely do not want to repeat whatever got you there in the first place. That same pain ensured countless others would not take the burdening consequences of being isolated. It might be this same mechanism that makes us so prone to conform and so subject to manipulation - we do not want rejection, we don't want to be lonely, to the point of doing whatever we can to fit in.

And yet, one can be mostly alone and not be at all lonely. I've always been very fond of aloneness. Most of the things I find most pleasurable in life are actually done on the solitude of my mind - thinking, writing, painting, reading, playing, and even sleeping. I find deep pleasure in being alone, but horrid pain in being lonely. Loneliness implies this unsatisfied craving for others, sorrow for their absence, despair for comforting, an unfulfilled thirst to love.

What strikes me as odd is that even though I've always had plenty of friends, solid family relations, and spent great amounts of my time alive with other people - all things that should satisfy my need to belong - I still feel this burdening crave for something more. A need that all those nights out full of people, the deepest conversations with the most intimate of friends, trying to help anyone that seems to need it, the adventures of casual sex, and even long threads about meaningful topics online never satisfy. I'm interacting, but not connecting. I should not be complaining, right? Never have we ever had so much capacity to meaningfully communicate with other human beings —  we are now at the distance of a call; a simple click on social media; an e-mai; for god sake, we're kind of doing it right now on this very same blog. And yet we still end up lonely — What are we doing wrong? Why aren't we connecting? 

What once might been physical barriers - to find another human being we had to travel (at least by walking to them) - are now abstract conceptual ones - the stupidly high barriers one has to surpass to reach other people. 

Individualism is one of the culprits. The individual has been undoubtedly at the forefront of industrial society and therefore aloneness is at the basis of modern life. Life is lived by the individual. That's why the millenary culture of the extended family, that for its communal benefits (and certainly less loneliness) followed all human and animal culture, started to disappear on the twentieth century and was replaced by the nuclear family. A man cannot be a productive member of society if he spends too much of his time and resources with is family and closed ones - that is not efficient, and therefore it doesn't benefit the collective interest. And so man must spend is life alone, make his decisions alone, work alone, shop alone... - only then can he be considered an individual. Even though modern bourgeoisie jobs are typically done with a team, there's these engraved idea of work relationships being impersonal - a strongly defined divide between personal and work life. Again reinforcing the ideia of being an individual within a larger group - one is no longer part of a community but of a whole society, an individual specific cog on a giant machine.

The instrumentation of man lead to its commodification, since he is now a product, and so his characteristics are his selling points. Individuality turned humans into transactional goods competing with each other in a free market just as any other commodity. To be simply human is no longer enough - we are above anything else both consumers and commodities to be consumed. Not only in the job market, but in every aspect of human life. Specially on human interaction.

Human relations are, just as anything else under capitalism, purely transactional. Identity becomes branding, personalities become strategy, conversations become advertising, actions become tactics. We are constantly trying to represent identity trough symbols - the brands we buy, the clothes we wear, the jobs we have, the media we consume, and the media we create. We are constantly symbolising our existence, that is itself based on symbols, that are themselves based on symbols, and hence forth. Everything is a theatre - our political ideology, our mottos, our ideias - wether we're conscious about it or not. Only this drives every human interaction. We choose to be with one instead of the other for their symbolic meaning - post modern tribalism (and therefore sexual selection) is not based on actual resources but on purely symbolic ones. 

This makes it impossible to meaningfully connect since all meaning is constructed with utilitarian purposes - where everything is a symbol with no real reference. We can no longer connect, because real humans don't exist anymore — we're all illusions, we no longer exist outside of symbols, we are purely abstract - our problems are abstract, our fears are abstract, our desires are abstract... Reality doesn't exist anymore, only symbols. And there's no way out.

So when I go out in the pursuit of meeting new people, and in the countless faces I see the infinite potential for wonderful connection. Every human is this complex creature with its unique features - ideias, fears, passions... but we are bereft of discovering such beauty by these abstract walls we've learned to erect. So I end up having only superfluous interactions - about meaningless job titles, vague political ideias, or market induced desires... - and go home feeling even more lonely than If I had spent my night alone. The sad truth is that love is incompatible with post modern society and so you and me are bound to be lonely.

## References
I usually don't post references but I really don't want to claim other people's brilliant ideias as my own, and I also want to share the readings that inspire my opinions that might also interest you. So expect it always from now on.

In this case most of the basis for this thesis comes from _Simulacra and Simulation_ by Jean Baudrillard that has the whole living in symbols theory (that I applied to loneliness here). 

The whole point about individualism on modern society from Foucault's _Discipline and Punish_ where by going trough the history of prisons he argues (quite convincingly) that post modern society is an horrible prison.

What inspired me to think more deeply about this topic was this wonderful little book called _the Art of Loving_ by Erich Fromm, which proposes that love should be seen as an art, and as such practiced, thought about, intentioned... and offers a view on how one might love on such an unloveable society.

So what are your thoughts? Do you also feel lonely, or do you feel like you meaningfully connect? If so, how so? Share your ideas with me by sending me an e-mail to [mailadhoc@protonmail.ch](mailto:mailadhoc@protonmail.ch), who knows we might connect.
