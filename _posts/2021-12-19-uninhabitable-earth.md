title: Life On This Uninhabitable Planet?
---

It's no longer a matter of discussion - we'll eventually not be fit for this planet. Human culture has developed way way faster than natural evolution. We have too many people, and the few resources we have are scarcening.
The sun will dry all the land. The fog will hide the sun. The plants won't photosynthesize. The air will become more harmful. 
Life expectancy is already dropping. It will only go further down from now on.
Earth's environment will gradually no longer serve the needs of our ancient biological needs.

I'm always suspicious when the cure to a problem is its cause. It's extremely counter intuitive. I can just imagine the first people trying variolation being extremely unconvinced that injecting the virus could somehow help them fighting it later. But since then the process (that has become what we call vaccination) has saved countless lives and eradicated many nefarious virus.

I'm afraid that the same will be said about technology. It is true that it was technology that got us here. We had to invent the steam engine. We had to build cars. And plastic. And medicine. And industries, with factories, and workers with salaries. 'For humanity'. No matter the cost. The cost is the crisis we're in now. The uninhabitable planet we've created. With air we shouldn't breathe, food we shouldn't eat, stress we shouldn't have, radiation we shouldn't get... and so on.

The scary thing is - only technology can get us out now.
If sunlight can't reach plants, let's give them artificial light. If there isn't enough land, let's plant vertically. If we can't have that many animals, let's biologically engineer meat. 
There's no other way out. Going back to nature is no longer an option, since we already destroyed it. We can either conform with our unfitness to the environment and so the eventual extinction of the human species, or create an environment in which we fit, which can only be done with technology.

I'm not hopeful that we will ever stop seekinh profit. Or adopt more sustainable structures for the sake of it. That we will ever choose empathy over power, or change our ways only for the welfare of humanity.

But I'm positive that if building an alternative artificial environment (which might not seem like the best choice, but unfortunately the only we have) is kept profitable, then the human species will not disappear as soon as we predicted.
