title: Consciousness Is Not That Special
---

I undestand why one might find what you may call the "soul", the "I", the "self" or even the "common sense" (glad you're reading descartes) so fascinating. From a personal point of view there's no doubt about it - all this absract feelings we have, linguistics, our capacity for reason, for wonder, and for all the fact we're able to give meaning to things. How is that possible? What can this possibly be happening inside our heads?

Well, I'm certainly not the first one wondering. In a world devoid of all our sophisticated scientific inquiry (before computers and modern  physics), no wonder you would atribute it to something external, beyond the physical. The whole branch of metaphysics in philosophy comes from it - this assumption that there's a barrier between what's physical (the synapses inside the brain) and the subjective experience they cause. Even if I had an accurate mapping of the subsequent states of each neuron, I would never know what it is to experience love - and that's where philosophy comes to aim, on the subjects physics just can't.

But then came Darwin. *The Origin of the Species* was a complete game changer. Despite its simplicity it touched nearly every field of knowledge, including  philosophy. Evolution gave a new scientific explanation for the old question of the 'purpose' of all life with an unexpected direct answer: survival. 

'Ok, but what about cousciousness? When dit is start?' Just as anything continous, it didn't. It's a process. Imagine being the first living being sensensible to light, and everytime you got hit, light disappears and you feel pain, then you will learn to avoid light, and you're chance of survival will increase because you now know how to avoid getting hit. That's where meaning comes form. You now give meaning to the absesnce of light, it means you're about to get hit, and you can act on it. That's the primitivie biological system behind what we call 'meaning'. Repeat that for generations and you get what we call 'consciousness'.

You might know how video compression works - to avoid computing every single pixel, the algorithm only focuses on the changes between frames. What you might not now is that our brains actually work in a similar way. We all have these intuition (maybe because of how we interact with computers) that our eyes act as inputs that send electric signals to our brains and then the brain processes it all. But just like a CPU, that's way too much resource intesive, such inefficient process would never arise from evolution. So how does it work? Actually it is the brain who first sends a signal to the optic nerve with what it expects to be excited, to only after the stimulus excite solely the ones it wasn't expecting. Which, as seen by the aburd time you wwait sending an RAW video file compared to the mere minutes for an MP4, saves a lot of processing power.

After I read such outstanding fact I realized I've already experienced first hand my brain glitching on this process. There's a thing I came across while studying arts called a 'Dream Machine', which is basically a way of indusing altered states of consciousness putting an intermitent light before closed eyes. On the fragments of the scattered light on the eyelids you're brain starts seeking patterns, it keeps searching for meaning. So in the colorful forms you start spotting shapes similar to faces, lions, claws... This is just my brain failing to righly check what it expected to what it got and so forming all this meanigfull images from memory. (If you're a neuroscientist contact, I want to know how worng I am, and also more about this).

What's even more interesting (which just shows how we independtly created systems just like our brains) is when you reverse image recognition intellegent algorithms on meaningless images (just as those emited by the dream machine) you get similar results to what your brain would produce on the machine. It might not be a coincidence that these type of images were coined "Deep Dreams".

As if this wasn't enough, and to prove this is not some figment of our contemporary imagination. When modern humans were asked to draw whatever they wanted while on DMT (a strong natural psychedellic) what they've created is suprisingly similar to the patterns ecountered on the wall's of caves painted by foragers seventeeth thousand years ago. Which means that stoners are not that new of a thing, but also that neither is concsiousness.

So what's my point here? Mostly that the way we usually think aboout cousciousness is faulty and just arrogant. We are the only species (at least that I know of) that claims to be the 'pinacle of evolution', or the end goal of all existence, because it has cousciousness. As it is the only species to claim to have an 'I', to experience subjectivess, and to 'think' (whatever that means). I reject those antropocentic views. We are nothing more than a jellyfish, or a dolphin, or an octupus, just because we can claim to have a 'soul'. For all I know they too could be claiming that on their alien ways of communication. Conciousness is not exlusive to humans, neither is meaning. We are not special, neither is conciousness.
