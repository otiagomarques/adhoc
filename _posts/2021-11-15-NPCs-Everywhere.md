title: NPCs Everywhere

If you ever played any game, you're probably familiar with the concept of NPCs (non playable charachters). It's those people you see walking on streets, siting on benches, doing an assigned job (like construction, police, supermarket...) on the streets of GTA. Basically just following a programmed path.

 I honestly cannot stop, in my daily life,  making a comparission between these characthers and most people. Most people act just like them. Blindly following orders and keeping up with their meaingless lives.
Like NPCs most people never get to think about why they do what they do. They never question authorithy and never felt the need to. They simply live, oblivious to the reason why.

I've met a lot of them troughout my life. And although I sometimes envy them for their well adjustability, I mostly pitty them. 

These people usually go through school with average grades without ever grasping whatever teachers are really saying there - the typical absorb and spit.
They follow whatever path is normal on their context. Higher class will attend industry standart universities, lower class will start working on the family branch.
They usually have great social life, their superficiality makes them great company. They talk about cars and girls if men, about fashion and guys if women. They love the most advertised films - the latest netflix specials or whatever big coprs put out next. 
They usually believe they are pretty happy, that the world has never been better, that they will socially ascend (even when they are already on the top one percent), want to have kids, and love routines. Whatever the status quo defines as 'normal'.

Maybe it doesn't look like so bad of a life, right? I believe it's the saddest. These people have the illusion that they are free. They lack critical thinking to put anything into question. They are unconscious slaves of the society they live in. And most of all, they are unaware of the beauty of life. They are wasting theirs. They have not the capacity to grasp life's wonder. They won't ever get the feeling of awe when listening to a beautiful piece, or reading a great work of literature. They will never feel the state of flow of creating something new (weteher it's writing, paiting, composing music, or even growing food, coding or discovering math). They are passive elements, they consume but never create. Or worse, only destroy.

And that's so, so devastating. There are so many people in the world, so much potential for meaning.  So much beauty to be discovered. And yet most people live devoid of such higher things, wasting it in worthless pursutis, ending up bound in the worst prison of all - society.

I hope to help create in which gradually less and less people end up there. A world where most people are truly free(just as the greeks proposed). Freedom is not doing  whatever you want, but being able to know  what's the right thing to do. And most people, just aren't.
