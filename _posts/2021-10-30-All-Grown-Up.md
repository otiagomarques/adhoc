2021-10-30-All-Grown-Up

‘You need to grow up’ they said. And I listened. I honestly thought growing up meant learning to think, getting critical, understating better and being free but it seems to be quite the opposite and just about accepting you are not, and never will be. It’s acknowledging you’ll have to work hours on end to be paid an entrance ticket to life. And all people ask me right now is ‘What are you going to do with your life?’ and although I don’t know what I want, I clearly know what I don’t:

Being sufficiently benighted to derive my life’s meaning from labour. To lack any interest in life’s utmost beauty whatsoever, but proudly drown in wonder by the blatant usefulness of being a cog; fully unaware of my utter uselessness, the suffering I’m causing or the self-sustaining nothingness of my job. I do not want this for my life. 

Choosing to create an human life only to burden it with guilt for the suffering it has caused me; feeding this endless cycle of self perpetuating boundness one generation further. I do not want this for my life.

Taking the miserableness of my life as an excuse to surrender to a spiritual being, to believe in an after life and to soothe my anxieties in lies. Avoid questioning, discussing, or even thinking on matters I cannot easily answer. I do not want this for my life.

Secretly worrying about social status, desiring the advertised newness of all those life-changing products that feed my self-actualisation and will surely alleviate all suffering. Feeling wholesome when buying from companies that claim to be sustainable or charitable, ignoring their actual practices. I do not want this for my life.

Consuming content solely for pure entertainment purposes, for its distracting qualities, something that makes me escape, not present. I do not want this for my life. 
Stressing out constantly on deadlines, meetings, and objectives since my family’s comfortable life is wholly dependent on income from my work. I do not want this for my life.

Considering 'love' as nothing more than having empathy for someone else’s suffering, forgetting the blissful experience of uninterestingly caring for one another. I do not want this for my life.

Care for a house I only sleep in. Marry someone I rarely see. Create lives I don’t have time to love. I do not want this for my life.

Unwillingly leave them sad and alone by slowly and painfully dying for all the carbon filled air I’ve breathe, all the pesticide filled foods I’ve eaten, and all the plastic filled water I’ve drunk. I do not want this for my life.

I might not know what I want, but I surely do what I don’t. And I do not want this for my life. But I’m aware I don’t have a choice, and neither do you. So I guess we have finally grown up.
